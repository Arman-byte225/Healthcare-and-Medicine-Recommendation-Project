# Healthcare-and-Medicine-Recommendation-Project
Medicine Recommendation System

This project is a Medicine Recommendation System that suggests appropriate medicines based on the entered disease name.

It includes:

Cosine Similarity-based Recommendation Model:
Suggests medicines based on text similarity between diseases and medicine names.

Classification Model:
A machine learning classification model that predicts the medicine category based on the disease entered.

Regression Model (optional):
A regression model was also experimented with, but not used in the final recommendation system due to lower performance.


Project Highlights:

Used TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity for NLP-based recommendations.

Built Machine Learning models (Classification & Regression) using Scikit-learn.

Structured project with separate folders for data, saved models, and utilities.

Ready to run with a requirements.txt file for easy setup.


Tech Stack:

Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas

Numpy

Scipy
